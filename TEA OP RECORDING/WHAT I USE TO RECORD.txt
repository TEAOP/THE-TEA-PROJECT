Alot of people dislike xbox game bar because of its low quality and fps but people just dont know how to change it lol
make sure you have xbox game bar installed if not just go to microsoft store and install it
click the windows key
search up captures settings
scroll down
Put the fps to 60
put the video quality to high
i used to use medal and all my clips are so bad quality cus of it and all of my clips with game bar have been very clean (medal does have a better interface and if you have a good pc i would just say to use medal this is for people that have an ok pc and want to be running 100fps open world and being able to clip stuff with high quality and fps

NOW
go to your settings home screen
search xbox game bar
for me 2 pop up but they are literally the same thing
it says enable game bar btw thats the one
change your keybinds if u want
I have my Record that keybind as Control+Shift+D and my Start/stop recording default as Win+Alt+R


TIP
search in settings for game mode and make sure its turned on it will increase fps
